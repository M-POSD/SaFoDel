    <string name="tip1_1_statistics" >Bicycle crashes are marginally more common (55%) at intersections</string>
    <string name="tip1_1_description" >TIP: If you want to turn right at any intersection, doing a hook turn is often a safer option (unless a sign prohibits it)</string>
    <string name="tip1_2_title">STOP AND GIVE WAY</string>
    <string name="tip1_2_statistics">15% of bike rider casualties occur when a driver or rider who is turning right fails to give way to an oncoming vehicle travelling straight through</string>
    <string name="tip1_2_description">TIP: If you are at intersections without traffic lights, signs or road lines, give way to any vehicle entering or approaching the intersection from your right</string>
    <string name="tip1_3_title">AVOID DOORING</string>
    <string name="tip1_3_statistics">8% of bike rider casualties occur when a driver opens their door into the path of a bike rider</string>

    <string name="tip1_4_statistics">Delivery Partners recommend you not to listen to music while delivering</string>
